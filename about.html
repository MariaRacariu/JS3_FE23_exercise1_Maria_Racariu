    <h1>Kinich</h1>
    <p>Kinich is a playable Dendro character in Genshin Impact.</p>
    <p>
      A Saurian Hunter from the Scions of the Canopy with the Ancient Name "Malipo", Kinich is a
      taciturn individual who has a knack for calculating the price of any request. He is almost
      always seen with the egocentric self-proclaimed "Almighty Dragonlord" K'uhul Ajaw.

        <p>
          Kinich uses his big-game hunting skills to either move swiftly or attack his opponent.
          When there is an opponent or object that can be attacked nearby, he will attach a
          grappling hook to the target and enter Nightsoul's Blessing with 0 Nightsoul points. If
          neither is nearby, he fires a grappling hook forward and swings in mid-air, and this
          Skill's CD is decreased by 60%. This skill can be Held to release. When it is Held, Kinich
          can aim the grappling hook.
        </p>
      </div>

        <h4>Nightsoul's Blessing: Kinich</h4>
        <p>
          Kinich's Nightsoul's Blessing lasts 10s and generates 2 Nightsoul points every second. In
          this state, Kinich will hook onto a nearby opponent and perform a variable attack:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            When using a Normal Attack, Kinich will fire Loop Shots as he loops around the grappled
            target based on his current movement direction, dealing Nightsoul-aligned Dendro DMG and
            generating 3 Nightsoul points. Loop Shot DMG is considered Elemental Skill DMG.
          </li>
          <li>
            When Nightsoul points are at max, he can use the Elemental Skill "Scalespiker Cannon":
            Consume all Nightsoul points to deal Nightsoul-aligned Dendro DMG. When "Scalespiker
            Cannon" is Held, Kinich can aim this shot. After firing the Cannon, Kinich will try to
            grapple to its target.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          While in Nightsoul's Blessing, after grappling an opponent or firing "Scalespiker Cannon,"
          a Blind Spot will be generated next to the opponent. When Kinich enters this Blind Spot,
          it will disappear and he will generate 4 Nightsoul points.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the grapple connection should snap due to exceeding the maximum distance or some other
          reason, using a Normal Attack will establish a new connection with a nearby opponent
          before performing Loop Shots.

        When Kinich is in Nightsoul's Blessing state, opponents hit by his Elemental Skill will
        enter the Desolation state, and when affected by Burning or Burgeon reaction DMG, they will
        restore 7 Nightsoul points to him. Nightsoul points can be gained this way once every 0.8s.

        After a nearby party member triggers a Nightsoul Burst, Kinich will gain 1 stack of Hunter's
        Experience that lasts 15s. Max 2 stacks. When Kinich uses Canopy Hunter: Riding High's
        Scalespiker Cannon, all stacks of Hunter's Experience will be consumed, with each stack
        consumed increasing the DMG dealt by this Cannon shot by 320% of Kinich's ATK.

        When Kinich is in the air following Canopy Hunter: Riding High's mid-air swing, he can
        consume 10 Phlogiston points to perform another mid-air swing.
      </p>
      <p>
        While in an area with Phlogiston Mechanics within Natlan, he can use Nightsoul Transmission:
        Kinich. When the current active character is sprinting, in movement states that result from
        specific Talents, or in the air, when you switch to Kinich: Kinich will perform one of the
        following actions depending on the conditions met:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          When facing a Coilgrass Sigil that can be interacted with: He will fire a grappling hook
          towards it to move;
        </li>
        <li>
          When there are nearby opponents and you are in combat: Kinich will use Canopy Hunter:
          Riding High in the direction of the opponents;
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Otherwise, Kinich will fire a grappling hook and swing, prioritizing valid Coilgrass Sigils
        as grapple targets. Nightsoul Transmission can be triggered once every 10s by your own
        party.
      </p>
      <p>
        When interacting with Coilgrass Sigils and other items that Yumkasaurs can interact with,
        "Canopy Hunter: Riding High" will be converted to "Yumkasaur Mimesis," which causes
        interactions with such items to follow rules applicable to Yumkasaurs, and which will not
        put Canopy Hunter: Riding High on CD.
