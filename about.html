      <h1>Kinich</h1>
      <p>Kinich is a playable Dendro character in Genshin Impact.</p>
      <p>
        A Saurian Hunter from the Scions of the Canopy with the Ancient Name "Malipo", Kinich is a
        taciturn individual who has a knack for calculating the price of any request. He is almost
        always seen with the egocentric self-proclaimed "Almighty Dragonlord" K'uhul Ajaw.

            Kinich uses his big-game hunting skills to either move swiftly or attack his opponent.
            When there is an opponent or object that can be attacked nearby, he will attach a
            grappling hook to the target and enter Nightsoul's Blessing with 0 Nightsoul points. If
            neither is nearby, he fires a grappling hook forward and swings in mid-air, and this
            Skill's CD is decreased by 60%. This skill can be Held to release. When it is Held,
            Kinich can aim the grappling hook.
          </p>

          <h4>Nightsoul's Blessing: Kinich</h4>
          <p>
            Kinich's Nightsoul's Blessing lasts 10s and generates 2 Nightsoul points every second.
            In this state, Kinich will hook onto a nearby opponent and perform a variable attack:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              When using a Normal Attack, Kinich will fire Loop Shots as he loops around the
              grappled target based on his current movement direction, dealing Nightsoul-aligned
              Dendro DMG and generating 3 Nightsoul points. Loop Shot DMG is considered Elemental
              Skill DMG.
            </li>
            <li>
              When Nightsoul points are at max, he can use the Elemental Skill "Scalespiker Cannon":
              Consume all Nightsoul points to deal Nightsoul-aligned Dendro DMG. When "Scalespiker
              Cannon" is Held, Kinich can aim this shot. After firing the Cannon, Kinich will try to
              grapple to its target.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            While in Nightsoul's Blessing, after grappling an opponent or firing "Scalespiker
            Cannon," a Blind Spot will be generated next to the opponent. When Kinich enters this
            Blind Spot, it will disappear and he will generate 4 Nightsoul points.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the grapple connection should snap due to exceeding the maximum distance or some
            other reason, using a Normal Attack will establish a new connection with a nearby
            opponent before performing Loop Shots.
